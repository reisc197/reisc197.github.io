<p> The son of Italian immigrants, Brazilian painter, teacher, and advertising and graphic designer
In 1953, he began incorporating circles and triangles in motion to his abstract-concrete compositions while making poem-posters of poet friends. The series Virtual (1958) focused on the tension that arises from the interaction between color and form, highlighting the spatial relations exposed by lithography. Beginning in 1960, Fiaminghi explored a concept he defined as retícula corluz (“colight reticulate”) and experimented with offset printing. As his work progressed, he named all his paintings Corluz, followed by their corresponding number. Due to their transparent and gestural qualities, these paintings appeared to the viewer as a mass of fluctuating color.
