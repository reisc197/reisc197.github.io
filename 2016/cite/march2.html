<p> Raúll Elbio Lozza was born in the early hours of the morning of October 27th, 1911, in Alberti, Province of Buenos Aires, western region of the humid pampas, territory of immigrants, land of cereal and cattle, where the Museum that is named after him stands. In 1933 Raúl became a member of the Communist Party. He endured persecutions and was imprisoned. While in prison he drew the blueprint of the torture chambers of the Special Section (the Secret Police) and the information about the existence of such chambers, once revealed, caused international upheaval.
