<h1> API Horoscopes </h1>

<p class="one"> Application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building applications. Vedic Rishi developed an API that deals with mantras, horoscopes, and astrology. This is a company based in India to report peopleâ€™s astrological analysis as well as matchmaking reports. This company works with many types of APIs. The one most interesting to me is the one functioning with gemstones. When plugging in the birthday details, a certain gemstone comes on the screen with a description of it.   </p>
