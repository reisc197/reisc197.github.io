  <h1>CURRENT WORLD NEWS</h1>
  <div id="news"></div>
<p> With this News API, I aimed to make a site in which when you refresh the page, a different headline would show up on the screen. Depending on its importance, the typography of the headlines would vary in size. This gives you the ability to move through headlines quickly and see what is happening around the world, if you then want to investigate deeper into the issue, you could look it up. The font family of these headlines would be either Helvetica or an old news type from the 2000s. This would all depend on the type of mood I would want to be going for. This site would be ideal for someone who just wants to see what is happening when they are at a busy day in the office. It would not be used to dig deeply into problems that are happening in the communitiws around us. </p>
