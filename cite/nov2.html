<p> Waldemar Cordeiro is perhaps the most important name of electronic arts in Brazil for the historic perspective. In the 1950’s, he was already one of the most prominent members of the Brazilian avant garde scene, as the main theorist of concrete art. At 1960’s, he advocated the learning of programming languages by the artist in order to extract the maximum relationship with the new machines that were being invented. In 1971, he organized the Arteônica event in São Paulo, the first major exhibition and conference on art / technology in Brazil.
