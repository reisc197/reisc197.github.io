<h1> Screensaver </h1>
<h2> Coco Reiser </h2>

<p class="one"> For my screensaver project I decided to make an animation that transmits a soothing and calm feeling toward the user. I used the color blue to make circles, and had them loop infinitely starting small and becoming big filling the whole screen.  Then they fade out when it hits 75 percent on the screen. The circles are a representation of rain droplets. I used the animation ‘grow’ for this project. I left the background color as white, to not have any distractions and make the focus only on the droplets. Each droplet has five circles with different sizes. I had the circles fit with the screen so that no matter where you move it, the circles stay centered. </p>  

<p class="one"> After I finished with the screensaver, I made it come to life by using a projector. This process was exciting because I was able to see how it looked in different sceneries. First I tried it out by projecting it on a wall of leaves in the garden. It was interesting to see how it looked so big in real life, and it was hyponotizing in a way. i thought there was more movement needed and I wanted to project it in a pool. This would be showing real water and having the pattern of fake water on top of it. I then projected it on curtains and had them moving with a fan from behind.
